		Frankie was a good girl
		Everybody knows
		Paid one hundred dollars
		For Albert's new suit of clothes
		He was her man
		But he done her wrong

		Albert said I'm leaving you
		Won't be gone for long
		Don't wait up for me
		Or worry about me when I'm gone
		He was her man
		But he done her wrong

		Frankie went down to the corner saloon
		To get a bucket of beer
		Said to the bartender
		"Has my loving man been here?"
		He was her man
		But he done her wrong

		"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story"
		"I ain't gonna tell you no lie"
		"I saw Albert an hour ago"
		"With a gal named Alice Bly"
		He was her man
		But he done her wrong

		Frankie went down to twelfth street
		Looked up at the window high
		She saw her Albert there
		Lovin' up Alice Bly
		He was her man
		But he done her wrong

		Frankie pulled out a pistol
		Pulled out a forty-four
		Gun went off rooty-too-too
		Then ALbert fell on the floor
		He was her man
		But he done her wrong

		Get me a thousand policemen
		Throw me in a cell
		I shot my Albert dead
		And now I'm going to hell
		He was her man
		But he done her wrong
